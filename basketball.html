                        The Phoenix Suns, after missing the playoffs for 10 consecutive seasons, are headed to the
                        N.B.A. finals for the first time since 1993. <br><br>

                        With a 130-103 road rout of the Kawhi Leonard-less Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night,
                        Phoenix won the Western Conference finals by four games to two and secured a berth in the
                        finals, starting July 6 or July 8. They will face either the Atlanta Hawks or the Milwaukee
                        Bucks, who are tied at two games apiece in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals. <br>
                        <br>

                        The Suns failed to close out the series at home on Monday night when they had the chance, but
                        Chris Paul, the former Clipper, made sure they didn’t squander another opportunity — clinching
                        his first career trip to the finals in the process. Paul scored a career playoff high-tying 41
                        points, including 14 of his team’s 16 points in a game-breaking span bridging the third and
                        fourth quarters, to turn the game into a runaway and provide a fitting capper to the Suns’ surge
                        through the West. <br><br>

                        Paul made 7 of 8 attempts from 3-point range after converting just 2 of 16 from long range in
                        the previous three games of the series. Devin Booker (22 points), Jae Crowder (19) and Deandre
                        Ayton (16 points and 17 rebounds) also made notable contributions as the short-handed Clippers,
                        playing their 20th game in 41 days, finally faded down the stretch.<br><br>

                        “Don’t lose mission,” Paul said in a postgame television interview, explaining his determination
                        to put the Clippers away and avoid a Game 7.

                        The Suns were one of just two teams during a shortened 72-game regular season, along with Utah,
                        to win 50 games. They validated that success, in many respects, by eliminating the defending
                        champion Los Angeles Lakers in six games in the first round, and followed that with a four-game
                        sweep of the Denver Nuggets. Phoenix had carried the league’s second-longest playoff drought
                        into the season, dating to the Suns’ trip to the conference finals in 2010. Only Sacramento’s
                        drought, now 15 seasons and counting, was longer.<br><br>

                        Yet skeptics continue to point out that the Suns have faced short-handed opponents in each round
                        of the playoffs. The Lakers’ Anthony Davis missed the final two and a half games of the teams’
                        first-round series because of a groin injury; Denver’s Jamal Murray had a season-ending knee
                        injury in April; and Leonard did not play in the conference finals after spraining his right
                        knee in the second round against Utah.<br><br>

                        The Suns, though, overcame their own burst of adversity against the Clippers when Paul, their
                        veteran floor leader, missed the first two games because of the league’s coronavirus health and
                        safety protocols. Phoenix managed to win both games without Paul and also overcame a broken nose
                        sustained by Booker in Game 2.<br><br>

                        Paul, 36, is with his fifth team. In 15 previous seasons, he had reached the conference finals
                        only once, with the Houston Rockets, and was sidelined for Houston’s crucial Games 6 and 7 with
                        a hamstring injury. The Rockets had taken a 3-2 series lead over the defending champion Golden
                        State Warriors in the 2018 West finals but lost both games without Paul. <br><br>

                        If the Suns go on to win the first title in franchise history, they would join last season’s
                        Lakers and the Boston Celtics in 2007-8 as champions this century who won it all after missing
                        the playoffs in the prior season. After losing throughout Booker’s first four N.B.A. seasons,
                        Phoenix narrowly missed the chance to participate in last season’s playoff play-in round. The
                        Suns had arrived at the league’s restart at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Fla., with the
                        second-worst record of the 22 teams that qualified, then went 8-0 in their bubble games.<br><br>

                        Convinced that the team was ready to the take the next step after its Florida success, Suns
                        management acquired Paul in a November trade from the Oklahoma City Thunder, absorbing the two
                        years and more than $80 million left on his contract. Paul’s veteran know-how, Booker’s scoring
                        and Ayton’s paint presence have combined to give Phoenix an enviable three-star core, with Coach
                        Monty Williams, who coached Paul for one season in New Orleans, supplying additional key
                        leadership.<br><br>

                        Suns General Manager James Jones, who hired Williams entering the 2019-20 season and made the
                        trade for Paul, won the N.B.A. Executive of the Year Award last week through a vote of his
                        peers. Williams finished second for the N.B.A. Coach of the Year Award, voted on by the media,
                        behind the Knicks’ Tom Thibodeau, after winning coach of the year honors in a vote by the
                        National Basketball Coaches Association.<br><br>

                        The Clippers, without Leonard and their starting center Ivica Zubac (also sidelined by a knee
                        injury), ran out of comebacks in Game 6 against Phoenix after becoming the first team in league
                        history to win two series during the same postseason after losing the first two games. They lost
                        the first two games at home against Dallas in the first round and the first two games on the
                        road against Utah in the second round but still secured the first trip to the conference finals
                        in the club’s 51-year history, which includes eight seasons in Buffalo and six in San Diego.
