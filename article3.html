                    <p>New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has reclaimed the number one position in the ICC Test
                        Rankings for batsmen after leading his side to the World Test Championship title in Southampton
                        last week. <br>

                        The 30-year-old's knocks of 49 and 52 not out in the low-scoring final against India helped him
                        move above the 900-point mark and he now enjoys a 10-point lead over Steve Smith (891 rating
                        points). <br>

                        India skipper Virat Kohli remains in fourth position while Rohit Sharma has moved up to the
                        sixth spot. India wicketkeeper batsman Rishabh Pant is seventh.
                    </p>
                    <p>Williamson, who conceded the top spot to Smith two weeks ago, is back in the position he had
                        first grabbed in November 2015 during a series against Australia. <br><br>

                        Ross Taylor, who scored an unbeaten 47 and partnered in an unbroken 96-run stand with
                        Williamson, has advanced three places to 14th position while left-hander Devon Conway has gained
                        18 slots to reach 42nd place after top-scoring with 52 in the first innings. <br><br>

                        New Zealand's fast bowlers too have gained after thriving in the seaming conditions with player
                        of the match Kyle Jamieson continuing the stupendous start to his Test career. <br><br>

                        His figures of five for 31 and two for 30 have pushed him up to a career-best 13th position, not
                        surprising since no bowler has taken more Test wickets at a better average than him since 1900.
                        <br><br>

                        Left-armer Trent Boult's figures of two for 48 and three for 39 have lifted him two places to
                        11th position while for India, vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane's progress of three places to 13th
                        position after scores of 49 and 15, was the only notable gain. <br><br>

                        Ravindra Jadeja has slipped behind West Indian Jason Holder to second position after a week at
                        the top of the rankings for all-rounders. <br><br>

                        In the T20 Rankings, West Indies' left-handed opener Evin Lewis has moved from 13th to 10th
                        position after a player of the match effort of 71 off 35 balls in the first of the two matches
                        of their ongoing five-match series that counted for this week's rankings. <br><br>

                        Left-arm spinner Fabian Allen has progressed 23 places to 20th position. <br><br>

                        South Africa's Quinton de Kock (up one place to 22nd), Reeza Hendricks (up three places to 24th)
                        and Temba Bavuma (up 24 places to 64th) are among the others to move up. <br><br>

                        England's 3-0 series win over Sri Lanka, which should come as a morale booster for the 50-over
                        World champions ahead of this year's ICC Men's T20 World Cup, sees several of their players move
                        up too. <br><br>

                        Chris Jordan (up five places to 11th), Mark Wood (up 11 places to 14th), Sam Curran (up 62
                        places to 39th) and David Willey (up 23 places to 51st) have progressed in the bowlers' list
                        while for Sri Lanka, Wanindu Hasaranga has moved up five places to fifth and Dushmantha Chameera
                        41 places to 43rd. <br><br>
