                    <p>Pride Month may be over but everyone’s story forever stay in our hearts.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes we get so distracted by holding onto a specific identity that we forget how complex and
                        expansive we are as individuals, and just how hard it is to reduce ourselves to one specific
                        label. Right from the moment we’re born, we start constructing our identities in ways that help
                        others make sense of us. Rarely do we then deconstruct those adopted identifiers of ourselves to
                        really understand what makes sense to us. To simplify, think of it this way: we have so many
                        labels attached to us based on various factors. We’re identified as someone’s – ‘child,
                        ‘sibling’. ‘grandchild’, ‘student, friend; we’re identified based on our looks – ‘the tall one,
                        ‘the one with long hair, ‘the one with cute jumpers’; we’re identified
                        based on our skin colour, religion, sexuality, gender, mother tongue, and so many other things.
                    </p>
                    <p>At any given point in time
                        we’re not just ONE of these things. And similarly, at different points of our life, not all of
                        these identifiers hold permanence. We grow, some of our identifiers change with us, we adopt
                        newer roles and labels, we drop some. And there in lies the bigger picture – that there is no
                        need to attach to a particular label to be considered valid and/or to exist.The aim then, for me
                        at least, is to understand that while labels are helpful and sometimes necessary in day-to-day
                        life, we are so much more beyond them and that our trueselves will still exist without said
                        labels. We can truly realise our potential by being aware of that. And there’s immense comfort
                        in knowing that Truth.</p>
                    <p>Being outside our so called social norms really causes a lot of trauma in people.I have one such
                        a friend who came out to speak about the traumas they face.</p>
                    <p>“”I don’t speak for myself but for all those who are still facing lot of issues in coming out to
                        talk. We people are always considered to be outside the social circle just because of our
                        orientation. In our current situation we people don’t need acceptance from others because this
                        is who we are but to leave us alone without bullying. The mental trauma that we face because of
                        bullying affects every part of our life. Just cause we are different we don’t deserve such
                        behavioral activities from others. In a society where people are still arguing over intercaste
                        marriages, it is difficult for us to come out with the truth. We people often fear of coming out
                        that we loose our individuality which destroys our self confidence and self esteem.</p>
                    <p>If normal men and women have the right to live in this society with respect then why not a person
                        who belongs to LGBT can live in this society with respect. It’s Not about what our religion says
                        it’s about what humanity says…If we talk about religion as per the Hindu aspects Lord Rama had
                        given a boon to hijras for their loyalty that’s why the curse or boon of hijras means a lot to
                        the normal beings.I think everyone who is living in this world, either normal or abnormal has
                        equal rights to live in this society with full respect..!!</p>
                    <p>I even faced a heart break from my relationship because my love was afraid to tell the truth to
                        his parents.He is forcing himself to become staright just cause he has fear of coming out.The
                        thing I learned from my circumstance is in order to come out we must be financially stable
                        because we don’t know how people would react when we come out which could affect our work
                        life.There are times when I deeply question me why am I cursed to be like this.Is this a
                        sin?.Whatever it may be I am also a human with a heart.I quote again we don’t need people
                        acceptance but let us be who we are and that is it “”</p>
                    <p>Happy Pride everyone. <br>
                        Never be afraid to be who you are regardless of what people say! <br>
                        Be happy! <br>
                        Be you! <br>
                        Be proud! Be loud!</p>
